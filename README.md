Why buy or use something else when one can waste a load of time building their own? It's way more fun. 

This is a work in progress project, full of half-assed code that one should not depend on. 

### Hardware Details

#### Orange Pi 3B 
For running the dashboard app and screen

#### Waveshare 10.4" QLED touch screen

#### Heltec ESP 32
Used to gather temperature and CAN data. Uses DS18B20 temperature sensors and a CAN thingy. It's particularly nice 
because I got tired of wasting time trying to figure out how to make the 1-Wire interface work on the 3B.
